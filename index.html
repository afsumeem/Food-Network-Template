                Food Network is a unique lifestyle network that strives to be way more than cooking, exploring new and different ways to approach foodI'm really not sure why I decided to add a 'favorite recipes' section in these website because I always want to pick them all anyway and I'm the worst at making simple choices.

                <p>
                    Butternut squash, known in Australia and New Zealand as butternut pumpkin or gramma, is a type of winter squash that grows on a vine. It has a sweet, nutty taste similar to that of a pumpkin. It has tan-yellow skin and orange fleshy pulp
                    with a compartment of seeds in the blossom end.

                <p>
                    A typical salad starts with raw greens, such as lettuce, spinach, kale, mixed greens or arugula. However, you can also
                    add several other raw vegetables.
                    
                    Some popular raw veggie toppings include chopped carrots, onions, cucumbers, celery, mushrooms and broccoli. These
                    vegetables are packed with fiber and plant compounds that offer health benefits.
